## Todos + Ideas
- additional effect types: 
  - +x lvl to specific enchant
  - whatever = slowness passive_nearby
  - lower merchant cost
  - plus enchanting lvl (lapis, maybe SME attribute)
  - plus gold from mobs (lol)
  - lifesteal + life degen
- Maybe make jsons shorter
  - put all of the same filter entries in a list instead of one entry per item
  - make attributes shorter as "generic.attackDamage +2 @0"
  - make potions shorter as "minecraft:slowness 20 1"
- should gems be instantiated on socketing or earlier? 
  - or maybe a possibility for rare gems to roll directly with stats?
  - like there should be an api to create gems dynamically from attached nbt instead of statically via json

### For addon mod (RLSocketed or whatever)
- Baubles compat?
- ddd compat if neccessary (maybe via attributes)
- Gem effects
  - plus skill (reskillable/levelup)
  - temperature attribute simplediff
