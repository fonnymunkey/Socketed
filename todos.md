## Todos + Ideas
- GUI socket tier draw
- gem tooltip tier draw
- Random value range on gem effects
- Config for what items can get sockets and how many
- additional effect types: 
  - +x lvl to specific enchant
  - explosion on hit 
  - give potion effect passively to surrounding entities (activation: passive_nearby)
    - glowstone = glowing
    - whatever = slowness
  - lower merchant cost
  - plus enchanting lvl
  - plus skill (reskillable/levelup)
  - plus gold from mobs (lol)
  - temperature attribute simplediff
  - lifesteal + life degen 
  - plus durability
- Baubles compat?
- Maybe make jsons shorter
  - move tiers to first line
  - put all of the same filter entries in a list instead of one entry per item
  - remove first line name? how to name file then
  - give access to slots "hands" and "body"
  - make attributes shorter as "generic.attackDamage +2 @0"
  - make potions shorter as "minecraft:slowness 20 1"
- gem that has uses til it breaks?
- should gems be instantiated on socketing or earlier? 
  - or maybe a possibility for rare gems to roll directly with stats?
  - like there should be an api to create gems dynamically from attached nbt instead of statically via json
- get sockets on craft, mob drop, loot gen, villager trades with separate chances + socket amount ranges
- rune words (config: has to match exactly, has to be in correct order)
- ddd compat if neccessary (maybe via attributes)
