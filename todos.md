## Todos + Ideas
- additional effect types: 
  - +x lvl to specific enchant
  - lower merchant cost
  - plus gold from mobs (lol)
  - lifesteal + life degen
- weather condition
- should gems be instantiated on socketing or earlier? 
  - or maybe a possibility for rare gems to roll directly with stats?
  - like there should be an api to create gems dynamically from attached nbt instead of statically via json

### For addon mods
- Baubles compat?
- Gem effects
  - plus skill (reskillable/levelup)
  - temperature attribute simplediff
